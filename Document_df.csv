9,"Yeah. Is this Yari. Yeah yeah hi ari nice to finally talk to you this is Mark with a prospector I've been looking to speaking to you today. I see. Last time you talked to us you spoke with looks like legit. How that go.

We will see both Bruce Wayne new mother Susan czar when you have.

Ok. All right. Well thanks for that. You know just to recap you and Lagena talked about last time last time I spoke last time we spoke our company Hot prospector has been in business for over four years and we have over 2500 customers worldwide. Our main focus is helping businesses like yours find and talk to more prospects and ultimately get more sales. Now I know this probably sounds like a funny question to ask you but I have to ask you this. Do you want to make receptively month.

Absolutely.

Great. Great. Well I'm going to see if I can show you a few ways that can help you make that happen. And you know if you like which see that I'd love to have an opportunity you are in your business today they sound good.

Yes.

Awesome. Now first what I'd like to do was to ask you a few questions so I know exactly what features the system I should focus on. Number one what do you find works best for you. Finemore customer you know I've been showing some you know SBO and things like that T2 primarily just ASIOs so people find you on line

And I do some online marketing support. Word of mouth also.

Okay. And how does that is that working

Okay. I could use more. Okay.

All right. Now how many more customers do you think you can handle each month.

Probably about 10 about 10. I see the team in place to be able to handle all that business. But again I said you have a team in place to be able to handle that amount of business. Yes. Okay. And what would you say that your average is dollar wise. Thousand 2000 3000 5000 now probably about 600 dollars the kind of dollars.

So a Web site for six hundred dollars yes.

Okay. Now how much do you want to profit on each of those. 25 percent 30 percent 40 percent.

So far about 40 percent and then you know we have the residuals.

Ok. All right so somewhere around 250 dollars per per customer.

Yes. OK. All right. Perfect. You know I definitely got a decent idea of where to go with this. I need you to do two things for me really quick. OK. Number one. Grab a pen and a piece of paper because I'm going to be giving you some numbers. I want to make sure that you have them for later. OK. It's going good for me. You got that yeah. OK great. Number two just go ahead and log into join me so you can see my screen forward slash hot prosector All right.

All right. I see you just joined here into the system and we're going to show you some really cool stuff here in just a second. It's going to definitely be able to help you you know get the customers right now. Wow. Well the thing that I'm loading up is loading let me just give you a couple of things to write down. First off going right down our Web site.

It's hot. They Ciotti prosector dot com OK. That's my web. OK. Just in case you need that later. OK. Next my name is Mark. That's a R.K. Holten HGL t o n.

And again one of the account managers here. OK. Now my manager says Mark at hot prospector dot com and my phone number in case we get disconnected is 1 800 5 9 1 9 3 1 3 you can just ask for me and I'll transfer you right to me.

Ok ok. All right now now that we've got that take care of you Spain right. Yeah.

Ok. So the first thing that I want to show you is this tool that we are going to be giving you today. That's going to help you to get more props. OK. Now I know you mentioned that you could use more prospects so the first thing I want to do is show you exactly how you can write them. Now what would you say is an ideal type of prospect for you what types of businesses do you like to focus on.

I'd like a contractor or just any small business really anybody you know want the Web site.

Ok. All right. Well there are a couple of things that we've found that works really well here with us because you know we have in the past actually done a lot of web development. We work with a lot of customers that do well. And what we've found that works really well is number one targeting people who spend money in their business right. A lot of people don't see that hourly. And actually having site so they don't own one but why would you want to target a person who doesn't see that value. So we do we target people who number one a have a Web site and number two have an interest in investing into their business online. Obviously you know it takes McDonald's to McDonald's to go out and buy French or potatoes in order to make French fries right. So we want to work with the businesses that understand that concept. Ok so this tool here is going to allow you to identify those types of prospects and you can see we have all these different search categories Mantell Yellow Pages Facebook Google ads Pfizer Groupon and Google. Now let me ask you this just taking a look at this what two categories do you think would actually have potential buyers.

The Home Advisor Groupon blue wall you know almost all of that because they're all advertising in some ways.

Right. Well actually you know there are a couple of them here that we find are the best. The first one we love. Okay okay. And the second one is Google ads. Now I'm going to be focusing here on the yellow pages today because I just want to show you exactly how important this is taxed. So you mentioned that you don't mind targeting contractors. We're just going to go out and Pangborn for this demonstration I'm just going to show select roofers and what you and

Las Vegas you're in Las Vegas OK. So let's just go ahead and do a search for roofers in Las Vegas. Now what you're going to love about our system is very simple to use. And it's also very fast. It's also going to get you a lot of extra data that you're probably going to be able to use in your marketing campaigns. And as you can see right here as it's searching you're getting a count of how many leads that you have in that area. OK. Now normally a search like this we would probably see anywhere from a couple of hundred two thousand leagues potential leads in just this one. OK. Now I mentioned also that there are some additional things that you're going to be able to get data data on these potential customers. First one I know that's very valuable to lot of our customers is to see if they have a mobile Web site or not. Now I know mobile is pretty hot right now. Do you sell mobile web sites.

I actually do on sellers Ronsard Web site.

Oh perfect. That's even better. Yeah. So this gives you the ability to see if their business is already using a mobile or already has a mobile Web site. Okay. The next do any type of online marketing or do any type of search engine ranking that sort of thing. We also get to different details on each of the businesses like you know how many citations they have. Are you familiar with what the term cit. means. Perfect. We actually check to see how many places online to name address and phone numbers listed. Obviously that's some good information that you're going to see is going to be able to help you when you're talking to your prospects. Now there's probably a couple of things that you're noticing her you're looking at this list. Number one there's no Web sites or sorry there's no email. All right number two none of this other data is here. Okay. So in order to populate populate that data we will give you the ability to just click a button and the reason why we do this is because we want to make sure that when you're parsing getting this information if you don't need it you don't have to wait for it. Okay. So we're first going to go ahead and we're going to parse these Web sites and what it's doing is it's going to each and every one of these Web sites and as having any additional information we can find like their e-mail address and their phone number. Now it's obvious you know when a business puts their e-mail address on their Web site they're asking for somebody to contact them so you don't have to worry about whether or not you have permission to contact these people because they're asking you to contact them.

There are a couple of things that you want to make sure you do which you know order to stay compliant. And that is when you're sending them an e-mail that you give them a way to opt out from receiving different or additional e-mail contacts. Number two you know you definitely want to make sure you use clear subject lines and put your contact information in all the e-mails you probably know this but we just like to get that you know little bit information to the people that we working with for good measure. OK. Now you're probably noticing here while this data is searching you can see up here off how many e-mails at five. Now depending on the type of categories are searching for the businesses that you're searching for you know these numbers are going to fluctuate. But we've found you know that the thing on where we're searching you're going to see anywhere from about 20 percent to 30 percent ratio of e-mails found per search OK which is pretty he said now and again. Now these e-mails are going to give you the opportunity to reach out to these prospects and turn them into customers. OK so that's doing its thing right now it's doing it so far. I mean and just let me know I'm not going too fast I mean are you seeing some some value here with what you're what you're seeing.

Yeah I mean I agree with you that I've seen the cost of things.

Yeah well there are a lot of different types of tools out there on the market.

We've seen tools that sell for like over a thousand dollars that do what this tool does. And I've seen the tools that do less than what the tool that that will you know felt a lot cheaper but they never were. So the one cool thing about this tool is that you know it's updated constantly and you know it's definitely going to help you get all the customers that are for. I'm going to give that a second to search and I'm going to show you exactly how you're going to be able to use this system while searching up here at the top cop of this screen. Oh and by the way as you notice we're at hot prospector dot com. But you see here how this is you know it doesn't say how prospected we've got all this know different looking branding going on here you've got the apex Apex digital strategies. The point I wanted you to see this is that hot prospect allows you to completely brand it forge your own business. So whatever logos and color scheme that you want you could search all of it. Nothing here. It's set in stone. So it makes it really nice so if you ever wanted to allow your customers to have access or maybe wanted to resell it you can do that and nobody would be the wife for that. This isn't how crossbencher can I. So it looks like our search is complete here. Now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and show you how we can get these leads into the system. OK. So what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and click on this export button and when we do that it will have different options the first one is a CSB export export which is just lets you open it up on your desktop and in Excel format. And then the other is an export into hot product. And basically all you have to do is just put in your username and password for your hot prospector account.

Click on the logon button and you'll be able to see.

You'll be able to log in give me one second here.

So just go ahead and log in here. Now once you actually Lagann you're going to see it's going to give you a couple of options here.

It said the existing group an added group what you can do and what a group is called are a contact group and contact group of contacts if you're loading into this or what we're going to do is we're just going to load this contact group right.

In this and just a couple of clicks you'll see all of those contacts have actually been exported right to. And all you need to do now is go over to your account and search and you'll see roofers Las Vegas fairs all of those leads that you just floated right here and some them pretty awesome right.

Right right.

Ok. Now you're probably wondering well what good is all of this data point. Right. I've got all of this data but what am I going to do with it. OK. Well what I want to show you a couple of different ways that you can contact their state or contact these customers actually or prospects to turn them into customers.

The first one here is our power diary now specifically here inside the system where you have the ability to literally click a button and call all of those contacts you want either one by one or all at once. The second thing that you can do is you can send out bulk e-mail to all of those e-mails that you just collected. But there's one specific e-mail that I think is going to be beneficial to you because you do web development because your site designer. We have built a specific tool that is going to help literally knock your customers socks off with your prospects CVS. They're literally just going to be blown away by what it is that they're about to see. OK. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put in an e-mail here.

We're sorry that address we'll just try your. Can you see my screen.

Yeah. It. You're not going to run an

I don't know probably because we're outside they're smoking it from isn't moving now.

No amount of I don't know what they saying.

Ok. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and put it on the Web site here. We're going to do. I don't know.

Give me a Web site address your web marketer gotten that all right.

So I'm going to go ahead and just put it in. You are going and I clicked the button and was going to go into that Web site and it's going to do a quick little audit of that site. So what specifically it's going to do is it's going to literally crawl every single page of that Web site it's going to search for a lot of different things going to search for header tags. It's going to it's going to search for descriptions going to search for Medhat title Medak keywords. It's going to be looking for how many images that the site is getting what types of keywords are in those images are all tags and those images. It's going to see how fast and what it's going to check out the domain and see how old it is. It's also going to look and see if they're on Facebook or on Twitter. I mean it literally goes on and on and looks at all of these different things that number one as really makes a difference on how it will sell.

But number two it's going to make you look really good to your customer. Now I'm sure that's probably something that would be beneficial to you. Right. Having the ability to have a tool that would show your customer just how professional your company is.

You can. Right.

Right. Right.

Ok so deep here at the top right hand side we have a contact information and this is something that you can customize so choose your contact info so when you send this report out to your product that they're going to see your contact information they're also going to see your local here at the top. So it's going to look like you sat down and put this really put this together for them. OK. Now the next thing this Web site green by Green this Web site great it is is it's actually a new analysis of the entire site. What it does is it goes to it it looks for all of the ones that are red are battling green are good and it just literally Girvan crawls everything on of those pages and then it calculates the score based on how many goods versus how many bats goes as high as 100. And as you can see everything explained here to your customer thoroughly OK. So pretty awesome right. You have the ability to send out a great report to your prospects literally with the click of a button.

I mean that's pretty awesome right.

Well let me ask you this.

What do you think would be awesome and that.

How about finding that out to every single one of the prospects that you just grabbed using this tool at once. So that means literally you can see about 70 text e-mails to all of your product mix with a couple of quick. Right. You saw here I went and grabbed the list. We uploaded it with a couple of clicks. Now we do this. You just click on the button here. Select your e-mail template which we don't have one in here right now but if we did you would just select it and then you check this box here that says Web report click update and it will literally go in after you click the Start button it will literally go in and create a Web site. Great and important for each and every one of those different businesses that you had searched for. Now if you were to send out a template or not a template for a report like this that looks like you really sat down and took the time to you know put your customer. What do you think you would get in the way of phone calls.

I mean if you were to send out let's say I think the thing I'm thinking it have to make it better.

Absolutely. Absolutely. Well now with I look about and you didn't read that report. Yes I'll definitely read it.

Can I Can you tell me what would flow like.

So don't worry I'm fine and you slow down a little slower. Sir be with it. Sure.

So you could see here you've got you know the index Egypt Egyptians on that Web site the readability level of that Web site. If there's a Twitter profile. Do they have a fan page. There's the Medard description that shows you know what the title is and then another description your headings images your domain. So with that expires the domain expiration MAS Reinke babblings literally everything that you need to know about that. They even tells you if they have a lead form on their site.

Okay. All right.

So anyway so like I said with the click of a mouse you will be able to send out 50 of the Web site reports or 100 of those or even a thousand of it's really up to you. And in a matter of how much goes that you actually pull. Now personally myself I'm not the type of person that would just send out those reports and leave it at that. I also would like to pick up the phone and maybe just follow up to make sure that you receive my email and you can actually do that again. Really simply and really easily when you log in you just click on this little green start guy or this little green dot. And what'll happen is it'll start calling these numbers here one by one and allowing you to talk to these people and you know you could call up and just say Yanhai 1 I just wanted to see if you had received that email that I had sent you one can tell you what the deal is if he says yes then you could come in here and you know add note any of those things that you want to add it like to meet your customers face to face.

You know you can actually get a location on where they are at. The Google Maps Bill right into the system. You have the weather if you want to talk about the weather with them you can do that. You can even send e-mail or a text message template with just a click of a mouse. So everything that you can imagine that you would need to do with a press tomor right here on top of that you can manage your contacts and contacts by the status updates. So you called and you sold them a Web site. You can fail and move them to a different group just like a fancy CRM or if you just they talk to you talk to them and they want you to call them back later. You could schedule a callback and with a callback you can collect the date in time. And also even send out notifications to the prospect to let them know you know that they have an ointment.

You were gonna say something no we disagree with you.

Okay perfect. Perfect. So again. So we've talked about how to get cross Cojo away where it just just one way that you can market to those prospects with a click of a mouse literally sending out not just you know a few but literally hundreds or even thousands of prospects prospecting reports on autopilot. OK. There's just one more thing that I had to show you. Well actually two more things I'd like to show you that we've built into the system and again there's a lot more where that came from. I'm just showing you a few things. I think you'll be able to benefit in a way. So the first one is down marketing campaigns.

Now do you have a phone system for your business. Not really. OK so when a customer calls in. What happens.

Oh no.

Ok. So I want to show you. Here is an actual campaign that we put together. So here's a campaign. You can see here the name of the campaign the contact group that we're using and then all the phone numbers that we're using in this campaign. OK. So what would happen is any time somebody calls this number then they're going to go into what we call a call flow call flow just basically means you know what happens after somebody dials. So the first thing that a lot businesses have these days is a menu option that will pop up and it'll greet the person who called and give them options that they call frass on their phone to do different things.

Are you familiar with that yet.

Ok. Now the types of things where you know somebody would press one for sales or press time for support or you know press three for you know to leave a message. OK. You have the complete control with option here to create your own menu options. All right.

And the way that works is literally you just grab it and then drag and drop it right on the little area where you want it to go and it will open up and you can have many options as you'd like. You can also remove them if you don't need them. And then here you can just drag over the types of things that you want to do when not the best. OK so that's that's one of our options. Another one of my really power one of the real powerful features that we have and a lot of our customers like is an automatic Esmat. Now you probably know this already but most people these days they use their mobile phone for everything. Matter of fact I don't even think you have a mobile phone. Or do you have a landline for your home.

I do have a local home.

Most people these days are moving away from their landlines that's actually a huge factor I think it's like 60 percent or something like that these days. People are using their mobile phone versus their landline and especially businesses they use their mobile phone over everything. I mean people are glued to those phones. Well what'll happen is when somebody calls to you they will actually receive an automatic message right on their phone.

Ok so for example what's your Web site your web marketer that are getting that high.

So what I'm going to do is just show you here your web marketer. So check that out. What will happen is every single time somebody call this number very first thing that they would get is a text message sent right to the phone. You could say whatever you want but it'll take them right to your Web site. And this is a really powerful way to get traffic to your site because people will get that get that phone or that text message on their phone click you are Reale and be taken right to their site to your site or if they have a smartphone they could just go right to your site online to get more details. OK. This is another very powerful tool that in a lot of our customers are using in conjunction with some of the other features that system that will literally have people drive driven from their site and drones. OK so the last thing I want to show you is just a couple of little things here. We have our own account accountant calendar managers built it. I'm sorry appointment manager built in to the system where you can actually sync up your Google Calendar and actually get all your appointments in one place and then there's one more really powerful thing that a lot of people need these days and that is online. Read our online. Literally you can come in and create your own lead form and embed it right on your site. So whenever somebody fills out a form their contact information will be put to your system that you can pick up the phone and call them or you can send him an email or a text message or you can put them in to one of our automatic autoresponder series to do this.

Mr. Adams: I don’t really recall the last time we had the burner checked. Maybe last year.

Jenny: I would like one of our service people to stop by so that you can take advantage of our free inspection and cleaning. Is Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. a convenient time for you?

Mr. Adams: My burner seems to be working just fine.

Mr. Adams: Okay, well, I suppose I could see you Wednesday.

Jenny: Mr. Adams, this offer will allow you to have peace of mind this winter knowing that you took the time to have your burner inspected and cleaned, thus reducing your overall fuel costs.
